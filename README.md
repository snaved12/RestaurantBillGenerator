Project Description: Restaurant Menu and Billing System

**Project Overview:**
The Restaurant Menu and Billing System is a web application developed using the Spring Boot framework. It provides a user-friendly interface for customers to browse the restaurant's menu, select their orders, and generate bills. The menu data is extracted from a MySQL database, and bills are generated using Jasper Reports.

**Key Features:**

1. **User-Friendly Menu Display:** The application presents the restaurant's menu to customers in a user-friendly web interface. Customers can view a list of food items and their corresponding prices.

2. **Database Integration:** Menu data is retrieved from a MySQL database, ensuring that the menu is up-to-date and easily maintainable. This integration allows the restaurant to add, remove, or update items in the menu with ease.

3. **Order Placement:** Customers can select food items from the menu and specify the quantity they want to order. The system keeps track of these selected items in real-time.

4. **Real-Time Order Preview:** As customers add items to their orders, the system provides a real-time preview of the selected items and their quantities. This helps customers verify their orders before proceeding.

5. **Generate Bill:** After finalizing their orders, customers can click the "Generate Bill" button. This action triggers the generation of a bill for the selected items and quantities.

6. **Jasper Reports Integration:** Bills are generated using the Jasper Reports library, which allows for the creation of professional-looking PDF bills. Each bill includes item details, quantities, and total prices.

7. **Clear Orders:** In case customers change their minds or want to start over, the application offers a "Clear Orders" button to remove all selected items.

**Technology Stack:**

- **Spring Boot:** The backend framework for building the web application.
- **MySQL:** The database system used for storing and managing the restaurant's menu data.
- **Jasper Reports:** The library for creating and exporting PDF bills.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** The frontend technologies used for creating the user interface.
- **AJAX:** Used for handling real-time order updates without refreshing the page.

**Project Benefits:**

- **Efficient Order Management:** The system streamlines the order management process, reducing manual efforts and minimizing errors in order processing.

- **Improved Customer Experience:** Customers benefit from a convenient and user-friendly interface for browsing the menu, placing orders, and receiving detailed bills.

- **Easy Menu Updates:** Menu updates are simplified due to the integration with a MySQL database. The restaurant can easily adjust menu items and prices as needed.

- **Professional Bills:** Bills generated through Jasper Reports present a professional and consistent format, enhancing the restaurant's image.

- **Data Integrity:** The database ensures data integrity and security for menu items and orders.

The Restaurant Menu and Billing System is a comprehensive solution that combines efficient order management, enhanced customer experience, and data integrity to benefit both the restaurant and its patrons.
